## Downloading Submissions

In Deepnote, the "click here to download" link in the last `grader.export` cell for submission may not work. 
While the submission will be successfully exported, the download link does not match. 
Instead, you will have to navigate using the file explorer (on the left side bar) to download the generated submission zip export.
